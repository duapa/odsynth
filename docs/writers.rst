Writers
=========

Writers work with the publishing system to write generated data to a specified medium. Currently the **local_disc** writer has been implemented. Writers are primarily responsible for writing data to a destination medium which could take any form, e.g. S3, Azure Blob Storage, REST EndPoint, etc.
